This is a test audio file placeholder for E2E testing.

In a real scenario, this would be an actual audio file (e.g., .wav, .mp3).
For E2E tests that require file uploads, this text file serves as a simple substitute.

File metadata:
- Name: test-audio.txt
- Purpose: Attachment upload testing
- Size: Small (for fast test execution)
- Created: Phase 5 E2E Test Implementation
